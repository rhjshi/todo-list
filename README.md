# Todo List

This is the classic todo list project that demonstrates basic programming fundamentals.
This project was built with **React.js** and uses **Semantic UI** to streamline styling.

Todo items are saved between sessions using localStorage, and the UI implements a MVC-like
pattern to maintain its state.

Functionality includes:
- adding a task
- deleting a task
- marking a task as complete
